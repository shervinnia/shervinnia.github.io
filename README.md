## Directions
Go to [bioviewer.net/flyer](https://bioviewer.net/flyer) on a desktop or tablet. Using your phone, scan the QR codes in the markers (or just go to [bioviewer.net](https://bioviewer.net) in your phone's browser). Accept the camera use requests and hold your phone steadily facing the markers. You should see proteins appear!

The source code for this website heavily relies on other software, and my implementation of it is free for anybody to browse or implement themselves.
